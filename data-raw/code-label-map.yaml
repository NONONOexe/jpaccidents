# Mapping of coded values in traffic accident data to human-readable labels
#
# This file provides mappings for converting coded values in traffic accident
# data into human-readable labels. The mappings are organized by categories
# such as document type, collision position, and impact type. Each category
# contains a set of codes, their corresponding labels, and display names in
# both English and Japanese.
#
# Fields:
#   - `code`    : Represents the coded value in the data. It can be a string or
#                 an array of strings. If it's an array, it indicates that
#                 multiple codes map to same meaning.
#   - `label`   : A string used internally by the program to identify the
#                 concept.
#   - `display` : Human-readable labels for display in the application.
#                 Supported languages are English (`en`) and Japanese (`ja`).
